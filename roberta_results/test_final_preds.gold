– It turns out Facebook is only guilty of about half of what it’s been accused of in the gay kiss incident.<q> The social networking site apologized yesterday for taking down an image used to promote a “kiss-in” event in London.<q> “The photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, and was removed in error,” the site said in a statement, according to the Advocate.<q> But Facebook did not, as has been reported in several places, take down the kiss-in event itself.<q> Here’s what happened: The photo Facebook took down was posted by the Dangerous Minds blog to promote the event.<q> In its initial write-up about the incident, the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down.<q> But it was actually the organizer himself who "removed" the event, Dangerous Minds clarified.<q> Organizer Paul Shetler explains that he decided to switch it from a public event to a private one, as "there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it."
– A 27-year-old Dallas police officer died Wednesday after being shot the day prior at a Home Depot in Lake Highlands.<q> The Morning News identifies the officer as Rogelio Santander.<q> He'd been called to the store around 4pm by a cop who was working an off-duty job there and noticed Armando Luis Juarez was behaving oddly.<q> The off-duty cop detained Juarez and learned he had an outstanding felony warrant.<q> Santander and Crystal Almeida, 26, responded to the scene; authorities say they and a loss prevention officer employed by Home Depot were shot by Juarez as he was being escorted from the store.<q> A source tells CBS Dallas Santander was shot in the back of the head and Almeida was shot in the face.<q> She remains in critical condition, as does the Home Depot employee.<q> Police say Juarez fled and a high-speed car chase ensued, per the AP.<q> He was apprehended Tuesday night and is being held on charges of aggravated assault on a public servant and felony theft.<q> "We got our man," said Mayor Mike Rawlings.
– In 1783, after the British soldiers left New York City, George Washington is believed to have stopped for a celebratory drink at the Bull's Head tavern.<q> Now a preservationist thinks he's found the historic site—and if he's right, it could be the oldest building in Manhattan.<q> Adam Woodward had heard that the building at 50 Bowery, currently scheduled to be demolished so a hotel can go up, might have "the Bull's Head's structure, cellar, bones," he tells CBS New York.<q> So he searched the basement, and "found myself in what I am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern," he says.<q> Specifically, he found what he thinks are hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls from the Colonial era.<q> Since that time, the building has housed a drugstore, a Chinese restaurant, and a beer garden, among other things.<q> Now he's hoping city officials will preserve the site, saying, "What an incredible opportunity that the city suddenly has for this thing to re-emerge."<q> A historian is also convinced it is indeed the old tavern, and investigations have been launched by elected officials and the Landmarks Preservation Commission, Eater NY reports.<q> But ultimately, the commission says, it "cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology," so a lot depends on him.<q> He's apparently not talking yet; the New York Times couldn't get hold of him.
– A Picasso painting that was found to have vanished from a Paris museum more than a decade ago has turned up—in the US, in a package shipped from Belgium.<q> Its papers identified it as a $37 "art craft/toy" and also included the line "Joyeux Noel," or Merry Christmas, the New York Times reports.<q> A man named "Robert" attempted to send the package to a climate-controlled warehouse in Queens, New York, in December, but custom officials at the Port of Newark seized what turned out to be Picasso's 1911 La Coiffeuse (The Hairdresser).<q> French museum officials traveled to New York last month and confirmed the find is indeed the missing Picasso work, which the Centre Georges Pompidou realized was missing from its storerooms in 2001 following a loan request; it was then valued at more than $2.5 million.<q> Court documents don't specify whether the sender or would-be recipient have been identified, NBC News reports, but "a lost treasure has been found," US attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement.<q> She filed a civil complaint yesterday that will have the painting returned to France.<q> The Pompidou's director, who called the painting's rediscovery a "true comfort," hopes the painting can go on display at the museum as early as May, the AP reports.<q> (Another Picasso work was stolen days before this one was found.)
– Israel launched a round of airstrikes on Gaza today, wounding two militants and eight bystanders, including some children.<q> Israel says the attack was retaliation for a round of Palestinian rockets fired yesterday, which Palestinians say were in response to another Israeli airstrike earlier in the day, Reuters reports.<q> More than 470 rockets have been fired from Gaza since June, but this was the first time Hamas acknowledged responsibility.<q> As usual the rockets failed to harm anyone, though one did kill some goats at a petting zoo.<q> The incident comes in the wake of a drone flight into Israeli airspace this weekend, which some have speculated came from Iran.<q> An Iranian military official today boasted that the incident proved that Israel is vulnerable, and that its anti-missile defense system "does not work and lacks the necessary capacity."<q> But he denied that the drone was made by Iran, saying such accusations represented a "psychological operation" on Israel's part.<q> "The Zionist regime has many enemies," he said.<q> Iran, meanwhile, is blaming Israel for a hack attack on its oil rigs.
– Not a big fan of Southern California?<q> Neither is Northern California, apparently.<q> Supervisors in rural Siskiyou County voted 4-1 Tuesday in favor of seceding from the state, reports the Times-Standard.<q> The county thinks state officials in Sacramento are too focused on the big metro areas of the south and thus want to form a state of its own—to be called Jefferson.<q> Supporters want to invite other northern counties, and perhaps a few from Oregon, to join, too, notes the Los Angeles Times.<q> ”We have to have government that's local, understands our issues, and has empathy,” says one local rancher.<q> It's clearly a very long-shot bid, one that would eventually require the blessing of both the state legislature and the US Congress.<q> Still, neighboring Humboldt County is expected to meet soon to consider the idea.<q> (Meanwhile, some counties in Colorado want to form a new state of their own.)
– The Supreme Court is facing a docket of high-profile political cases that will test whether recent liberal victories were more fluke or firm conviction, the New York Times reports.<q> The court—which is divided 5-4 for conservatives, but saw Justice Roberts vote liberal on Obamacare and same-sex marriage—will look at cases including unions, affirmative action, and possibly abortion.<q> A primer: Unions: Since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones.<q> Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political.<q> "It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues," a lawyer says.<q> Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008.<q> The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket.<q> Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs.<q> The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports.<q> Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional.<q> "One person, one vote": Should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters?<q> If justices choose the latter—leaving out immigrants and children—Latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain, Politico reports.<q> Abortion: Justices may opt to revisit a Texas law that could reduce the state's abortion clinics from more than 40 to roughly 10.<q> At issue is whether new clinic requirements are an "undue burden" on women's right to an abortion.<q> One commentator believes this Supreme Court session will be ugly for liberals.
– It's a race for the governor's mansion in 11 states today, and the GOP could end the night at the helm of more than two-thirds of the 50 states.<q> The GOP currently controls 29 of the country's top state offices; it's expected to keep the three Republican ones that are up for grabs (Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana), and wrest North Carolina from the Dems.<q> That brings its toll to 30, with the potential to take three more, reports NPR.<q> Races in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington are still too close to call, and in all three, Democrat incumbents aren't seeking reelection.<q> The results could have a big impact on health care, since a Supreme Court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion.<q> "A Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors," said one analyst.<q> Click for NPR's state-by-state breakdown of what could happen.
– Why did Microsoft buy Nokia's phone business?<q> We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports.<q> But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: "Fear of dying alone."<q> Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation "manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic," Herman argues—like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market.<q> "It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company … missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways.<q> Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes.<q> But it's not so sure that's a good idea.<q> "There already is an apple," the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel.<q> Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS.<q> The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet.<q> But he adds that "Microsoft needed to make a bold move" or face "certain terminal decline," and that the price it paid for Nokia "seems extremely reasonable."<q> Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform—a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move—to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone.<q> Of course, Yglesias notes, that move "was basically a total failure."<q> To read the full parable, click here.
